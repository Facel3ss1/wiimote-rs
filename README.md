# wiimote-rs

This is a very WIP project for communicating with Wii Remotes over Bluetooth
using the Windows API. It may or may not work for you, no guarantees!

My hope is to turn this into a library I can embed into other applications so I
can use Wiimotes in other projects, but that's a long way off.
